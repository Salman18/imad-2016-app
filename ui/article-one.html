                   1. <b>Choosing a Language.</b>
                      <i>choose a programming language. Computer programming is done as essentially a set of written instructions that computer follows (also known as binary coding). These instructions can be written in a number of different "languages", or which are simply different ways of organizing the instructions and text. Different languages tend to be used to create different types of programs, however, so choose a language that you feel is relevant to what you want to do. If you decide that a language does not suit your needs, you can always move on to a new language.</i>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     2.<b>Consider Java or JavaScript.</b> 
                     <i>These are good languages to learn if you want to work on making web plugins (JavaScript) or mobile apps (Java). These languages are very much in demand right now, so they are handy to know. Keep in mind that Java and JavaScript are completely different languages, despite the similarity in names.</i>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     3.<b>Try Python.</b>
                      <i>Python is a very versatile language used widely across several platforms. Despite being extremely powerful, it is an easy language for a beginner to pick up, so give it a try!</i>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     Don't limit yourself to these languages! There are tons of programming languages, all with varying uses. If you want to work as programmer, you will definitely need to know more than one, so learn as many as you can.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     Continue programming and trying new things! To be a good programmer you, at the very least, have to keep up with changing technology. It's a constant learning process, and you should always be learning new languages, new paradigms, and most importantly: programming new things!
